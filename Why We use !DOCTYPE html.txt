We use <!DOCTYPE html> at the beginning of an HTML document to tell the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in.

Here's why it's important:
Standards Mode Activation: It ensures the browser renders the page in standards mode, not in quirks mode (a legacy rendering mode that mimics older, non-standard behavior of old browsers).

HTML5 Declaration: <!DOCTYPE html> is the doctype for HTML5, the current standard. It's short, simple, and tells modern browsers: “This is an HTML5 document.”

Without it:
Browsers might guess the document type and render the page incorrectly, which can cause inconsistent layouts and bugs across different browsers.
